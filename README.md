# InPainting-CelebA

This project performs image inpainting on the CelebA dataset, specifically targeting and reconstructing missing mouth regions on smiling faces. The goal is to train a model that can convincingly reconstruct smiles on masked images.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: CelebA dataset, filtered for smiling images and processed to mask mouth regions.
- **Model**: GAN-based inpainting model.
- **Scripts**: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
